// --- CYBERSECURITY ANALYSIS ---
/*
 * This section provides a detailed analysis of the code from a cybersecurity perspective.
 * The scores are based on a comparison to other similar open-source projects and general
 * security principles. The scale is 1-10, where 1 is poor/simple and 10 is excellent/highly advanced.
 */

/*
 * 1. Implementation & Completeness: 8/10
 * 
 * Explanation: This score is high because the project is a fully-functional, multi-faceted attack tool.
 * It doesn't just implement one type of attack, but three distinct ones that run cooperatively.
 * - It correctly uses the ESP8266 for what it's good at: 802.11 packet injection.
 * - It correctly uses the NRF24L01+ for what it's good at: raw, high-power RF transmission.
 * - The code is self-contained and manages its own timing and targeting, requiring no user interaction after launch.
 * Many simple online projects only implement a basic deauth attack OR a simple RF flood on a single channel.
 * This code is significantly more complete by combining them and adding intelligent targeting.
 */

/*
 * 2. Effectiveness & Potency: 9/10
 * 
 * Explanation: The effectiveness of this tool is extremely high for its cost and simplicity.
 * - Layered Attack: By attacking both the protocol layer (Wi-Fi deauth) and the physical layer (RF noise),
 *   it can disable a very wide range of devices. A device immune to deauth attacks (e.g., using WPA3)
 *   would still be vulnerable to the raw RF jamming, and vice-versa.
 * - Adaptive Targeting: The `scanChannels()` function makes this tool "smart." Instead of blindly jamming
 *   all channels (which would dilute its power), it focuses its energy on the 5 most active channels.
 *   This is a critical feature that dramatically increases its potency compared to a simple, single-channel jammer.
 * - Multi-Protocol Disruption: Explicitly targeting Wi-Fi, general 2.4GHz, and BLE advertising channels
 *   ensures a very broad impact within its operational range.
 */

/*
 * 3. Stealth & Evasion: 3/10
 * 
 * Explanation: The score is low because the tool makes no attempt to hide its presence. Its very function
 * is to be as "loud" as possible on the radio spectrum.
 * - Deauth Frames: While the source MAC address is fake, the deauthentication frames themselves are a clear
 *   and obvious sign of a targeted attack that can be detected by any Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
 * - RF Noise: The high-power, continuous signal from the NRF24L01+ would be immediately visible on any
 *   spectrum analyzer as abnormal, wideband noise. This makes the physical device relatively easy to locate
 *   with the right equipment (a technique known as "fox hunting").
 * - Predictable Patterns: While the jamming data is somewhat randomized, the timing of the attacks is fixed
 *   in the code, which could potentially be fingerprinted.
 */

/*
 * 4. Sophistication & Novelty: 7/10
 * 
 * Explanation: While the individual techniques (deauth, jamming) are well-known, the combination and
 * implementation here are more sophisticated than typical hobbyist projects.
 * - Cooperative Model: The concept of using two different radio modules for their specialized strengths
 *   is a clever design choice that overcomes the limitations of each individual module.
 * - Intelligent Scanning: The adaptive channel scanning is the most sophisticated part of this code.
 *   It elevates the tool from a blunt instrument to a targeted weapon.
 * - Low-Level Control: The use of `wifi_send_pkt_freedom` demonstrates a deeper understanding of the hardware
 *   capabilities than simply using standard library functions.
 * It is not novel in the sense of a zero-day exploit, but it is a novel combination of existing techniques
 * in a low-cost, accessible platform.
