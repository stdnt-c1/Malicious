This document outlines the security policy and responsible disclosure guidelines for Project Gracia.

## 1. Guiding Principle: Defense Over Offense

The core philosophy of this project is that understanding offensive techniques is a critical component of building robust defensive systems. Every tool and script provided here is for **educational demonstration** to help researchers, students, and developers learn how to protect networks from real-world threats. **This project is a classroom, not a weapon.**

## 2. Reporting Vulnerabilities & Responsible Disclosure

While this project is designed to demonstrate vulnerabilities, there may be flaws in the scripts themselves. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project's code, please adhere to the following responsible disclosure process:

1.  **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**
2.  Privately and securely report the vulnerability to the project maintainers.
3.  Allow a reasonable amount of time for the vulnerability to be assessed and patched before any public disclosure.

## 3. Security Best Practices (for Users)

As this project contains scripts capable of disrupting wireless communications, adherence to these rules is not optionalâ€”it is a prerequisite for using the software.

*   **Lawful Use Only:** You will not use this software for any unlawful purpose. You are responsible for knowing and complying with all local, state, national, and international laws regarding wireless communications and cybersecurity.
*   **No Unauthorized Testing:** You will **never** use these tools on any network, device, or system for which you do not have explicit, prior, written consent. This includes public Wi-Fi, corporate networks, and residential networks.
*   **No Malicious Activity:** You will not use this software to harass, disrupt, or cause harm to any individual, organization, or system.
*   **Assume Full Responsibility:** You, the user, assume all legal and ethical responsibility for any actions performed with this software. The creators and contributors of this project are not liable for any damages or legal consequences resulting from your misuse of these tools.

## 4. Known Security Issues

Currently, there are no known unpatched security vulnerabilities within the project's codebase. Any discovered and patched vulnerabilities will be documented here with their respective CVEs (if applicable) and mitigation steps.

**Remember: The knowledge gained from this project should be used to build a more secure digital world, not to tear it down.**
