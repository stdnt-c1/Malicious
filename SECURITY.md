# Security Policy & Code of Conduct

This document outlines the security policy, responsible disclosure guidelines, and code of conduct for Project Gracia. As this project contains scripts capable of disrupting wireless communications, adherence to these rules is not optionalâ€”it is a prerequisite for using the software.

---

## 1. Guiding Principle: Defense Over Offense

The core philosophy of this project is that understanding offensive techniques is a critical component of building robust defensive systems. Every tool and script provided here is for **educational demonstration** to help researchers, students, and developers learn how to protect networks from real-world threats. **This project is a classroom, not a weapon.**

## 2. Code of Conduct & Rules of Engagement

By cloning, downloading, or using this repository, you explicitly agree to the following terms:

*   **Lawful Use Only:** You will not use this software for any unlawful purpose. You are responsible for knowing and complying with all local, state, national, and international laws regarding wireless communications and cybersecurity.
*   **No Unauthorized Testing:** You will **never** use these tools on any network, device, or system for which you do not have explicit, prior, written consent. This includes public Wi-Fi, corporate networks, and residential networks.
*   **No Malicious Activity:** You will not use this software to harass, disrupt, or cause harm to any individual, organization, or system.
*   **Assume Full Responsibility:** You, the user, assume all legal and ethical responsibility for any actions performed with this software. The creators and contributors of this project are not liable for any damages or legal consequences resulting from your misuse of these tools.

**Violation of this code of conduct constitutes a misuse of the project, and any support or assistance from the community will be denied.**

## 3. The Definition of Misuse

Any use of this project outside of a **personally owned, isolated, and controlled laboratory environment** is considered misuse. Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to:

*   Running the deauthentication script at a coffee shop, school, or office.
*   Using the RF jammer in a residential area or public space.
*   Targeting a neighbor's Wi-Fi network.
*   Deploying the beacon flood attack at an airport or public event.

These actions are illegal and can have serious consequences, including fines and imprisonment. They can also cause significant disruption to critical services, including security systems and communication devices.

## 4. Reporting Vulnerabilities & Responsible Disclosure

While this project is designed to demonstrate vulnerabilities, there may be flaws in the scripts themselves. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project's code, please adhere to the following responsible disclosure process:

1.  **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**
2.  Privately and securely report the vulnerability to the project maintainers.
3.  Allow a reasonable amount of time for the vulnerability to be assessed and patched before any public disclosure.

## 5. Consequence of Misconduct

This project is offered for educational purposes under the assumption that it will be used responsibly. Any user found to be using the project for malicious purposes will be publicly disavowed and, where applicable, reported to the relevant authorities. We do not condone illegal activity and will cooperate with law enforcement investigations into the misuse of this software.

**Remember: The knowledge gained from this project should be used to build a more secure digital world, not to tear it down.**
